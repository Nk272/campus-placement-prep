# Campus-Placement-Preparation :
Hi Folks, good to see you here! If you are human, you are in a great place. In this doc, I'll share my experiences while I was preparing for my campus placements. I'll try to cover as many aspects. I hope this will help all the students prepare for their first full-time job (either through Campus Placements or Applying through Off-Campus). If you are planning to apply for a job in the coming years, this doc will help you, and if you have gone through that phase, I request you to contribute, please; this will help our juniors.

### A brief about myself:

As of December 2020, I am a final year undergraduate student at the Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Roorkee. I'm a Software Developer, and my areas of interest are Security, Cloud, and the Internet of Foods. I have offers from Oracle, Cisco, and Amazon, and I have decided to move forward with Oracle. I have worked at Cisco in Silicon Valley for one year under the Cisco International Internship Programme. Before that, I went for an internship in Cloud Computing at IIT Kharagpur. Like my friends, I wasn't sure of building a career in software right from the start of my college, and I started off exploring Chemical Engineering (Industry and Research). I have published a research paper in Bioenergy. I was invited to present my work at the International Conference (fully funded :p). Later I explored Interdisciplinary Research and gradually shifted to Software Development, and that's when my journey started (~ at the end of my second year). CSec takes up most of my free time. If you are into security, we'll vibe :p.

### How Campus Placements look like at IITs
Before the strategy, let me brief you about the placement process. It starts around September/October. The first few weeks are for Resume building and Verification. This typically involves gathering all the certificates and documents about the achievements that a student wants to write in his/her resume. I personally believe IITR has a strict verification process and a student has to prove everything except his name, branch, year, and cgpa. After this, companies start visiting the campus and organize a Pre-Placement Talk (PPT). After the PPT, they organize tests/competitions depending upon the job profile they are offering. These competitions could range from group discussions to guestimates to submitting assignments. These things i.e.the PPTs and the tests for different companies happen in parallel and could happen at any point in time in a day. Some of my friends who applied in international positions had to attend PPTs even after midnight, and sometimes as early as 4 AM. The same happens with the tests as well. This happens for months (typically till mid-December). Meanwhile, after the second week of November, companies start to announce the list of students who have made through the tests and are shortlisted for interviews. They also announce the waitlisted students, but all the interviews happen together starting December 1st at midnight, with the exceptions of the PSUs (these may happen any day earlier). Interviews happen in slots, and each slot has multiple companies, and their interviews happen in parallel. A student can have two interviews at the same time, but he has to manage it by himself, also the placements teams are quite supportive in this as well. Before every interview slot, each student has to fill in the priority form for the companies interviewing in a particular slot in case a student gets multiple offers from the same slot. Once a student gets an offer, he has to accept it and he is out of the placement session.

### My Campus Placement Experience :

In February 2020, I was pretty confident that I would not have to sit in Campus Placements as I was expecting an offer from Cisco, USA. My team was doing great. They wanted to hire full-time developers, and I was pretty confident that I will have a chance. While I was planning my trips to Hawaii, Denver, NY, and Washington, there came something no one expected. Yes, Mr. Covid, and that's when everything started turning around. Till May, I have been waiting for my offer, but then things were at the valley, and Cisco went under a hiring freeze, and strict cost cut down. In July, I decided to move on, but this left me with only four months (August - November) for my preparation. While I had experience in development, I had no prior experience in Competitive Programming; I had to start right from the beginning. While I was losing my nerves because of covid, I knew that it would be challenging. Since I extended my degree by one year and all of my close friends graduated last year, it worsened. I knew that if I have to get a decent job, I'll have to strategize and play smart, and that's when I started contacting my seniors and friends to set up timelines and a plan. Trust me, everyone had something different to speak about, and I was overwhelmed. At one point, I was pretty confident that I should cover up everything. Still, as time passed, I realized that covering everything is never a good idea. Given the circumstances, I didn't really have time for that. I would like to share my experiences, mistakes, and challenges through this doc, hoping it helps the readers.

### My Strategy

While I specifically prepared for software roles, almost all of the tests I gave had a coding test (on platforms like HackerRank, HackerEarth, mettle, and others). Some companies asked for an aptitude test and some even personality tests (typical banksÂ :p). From the very start, I knew that I do not want to go with the banks, as they do not have a good software culture and I believe the future in the software is not so good there. But, I still applied to most of the famous banks, as I wanted to increase my number of interviews, because that keeps me motivated. Till November 30th, I had a target, to get as many interviews as possible, that's what every student tries. I had around 8 interviews on Day 1 and I was lucky to get an offer in slot 1.1 itself. But I have seen my friends losing motivation as the slots passed with them not getting an offer. In that situation, a person's condition gets even worse with time, if things do not go as they expected. Trust me, it's like a nightmare, and no one wants to be in that condition. While I've seen this phase 2 years ago when my seniors were preparing for their placements, I really do not want this to happen with myself or my friends, and straightway after I got an offer, I started helping my friends. If you are a junior, I'd request you to help your seniors if you can.

We know that "perpetual optimism is a force multiplier" and "negativity hinders the performance." We can talk about optimism all throughout, but when it comes to the self, I found it hard to implement myself, and I am sure this happens with most of the students. I had created tonnes of timelines, most of them failed :p. So, the most significant challenge I had was to avoid this situation. While it may be tough to eliminate it, but we can anyways try to minimize them. Here's what I did:
At the start, I was looking forward to forming a small group as it helps a lot. It keeps you competitive throughout, motivates you when you're feeling low, helps avoid distractions, keeps you on track, and provides multiple perspectives for the same problem. While I struggled to form a group, but I had discussions with my peers quite often. I'd recommend having a group of 3-5 students. I believe forming a large group leads to distractions.
It was sure that Campus placements are going to be affected by the covid; most of the students were already hysterical because of it. And the students from not IT branches were affected the most. So, if everyone's impacted, there's no point in thinking about it. I have seen many people talking just about the problems. Even though deep inside, they feel that they might not be directly impacted by it. It can be seen as analogous to a topper of the class saying, "I haven't studied anything for the exam." From my experience, I think that talking about a problem, even though it may or may not be impacting you, is not a good idea. It's definitely not useful in the longer run.
Four months is a long duration, and it is seen that many students fall sick during their preparations, which could range from catching a mild cold to Dengue. I have seen students testing positive for covid-19 to meeting road accidents. I have also seen students not able to give exams because of it. While most students do not realize this factor, it is vital to keep yourself healthy and safe. After all, you don't wanna miss any of the chances. Research says that junk food really impacts the mindset and makes us lazy, and I have personally felt this. I'd recommend having a healthy diet (An apple a day keeps the doctor away :p) and basic body movement (if you cannot devote time to exercise). I used to take time for a short walk whenever I used to have discussions on a call. And yes, having sunlight for around 5 minutes is very important as well. It helps in maintaining a sound body and mental health. Needless to say, proper sleep is vital, as well. I used to sleep for at least 7-8 hrs daily, and then around 30 minutes during the day, after the meal. Sleep is a very powerful focus-booster, and I think challenging sleep for a longer time is not a good idea at all. 
Sometimes, studying the same topic for a long time could be monotonous and becomes ineffective. I have been through the times when I used to spend hours on a piece of code. Sometimes, debugging 20 lines of code takes way more time than the time required to write it from scratch. Whenever this happened, I used to divert my attention to something else or maybe a quick break. I used to study two subjects simultaneously, swapping between them every few hours (Obv 10 minutes of rest every 60 minutes). This has helped me retaining focus for longer durations. Whenever I used to feel like I don't wanna study, I listened to blogs (I use a chrome extension for narration).
From my friends' and seniors' past experiences, I knew that most of the students leave revision for the very last moment, and they fail to calculate the timelines for it. The pressure's very high at that time, and the course is vast; the chances of getting overwhelmed are very, very high. All of my friends (including me) were crushed by the massive syllabus during the last two weeks of November. Plus, the number of tests increases to up to 5-6 tests per day, and the focus is shifted multiple times. So, it is imperative to maintain calm and study efficiently at that time. I used to create two levels of notes for the revision. I would have concise notes, and in the other, I just had headings of the topics that I felt were necessary for the revision. While everyone has their own strategy for revision, I found this very effective fr myself.
I also believe that making timelines for achieving a target is a good idea, but try refraining from making timelines for a longer duration. I usually feel lesser motivated for more extended targets. Hence, I used to restrict myself from making timelines for about 2 weeks, making them a bit stricter than I could actually achieve. Failing timelines kept me motivated, and I always strived to perform better to achieve the targets.
I faced the placement session from my home. I used to believe that hundreds of distractions in my house (family discussions, functions, siblings fights, kids, and many others) impact my performance. Trust me, it's completely normal, and there's no point in being negative about it. In turn, it has multiple benefits as well, from getting healthier meals to lesser movements. You get mental support from the family and get to live with them as well.
One important thing is to decide the syllabus; I asked multiple seniors, all of them had something new to say. While every senior explained why those particular topics are essential, it is not the best idea to follow them blindly. It is very crucial to decide on the topics and the corresponding depth for each one of them. Obviously, having more knowledge is better, and it might seem tempting. Still, since we are limited by time, and we got only one shot for each company, it is better to be strategized.
Also, during the preparation phase, I tried to stay away from gloomy students, the ones who were always negative about anything, and instead of being positive about learning new concepts, they would rather say that there's more to learn. While some such students say that they are not affected by such talks, I believe both the speaker and the listener are affected passively and I wanted to avoid all such impacts.
On top of all these, meditation is a great add-on and it improves the performance multifold if you're regular. I cannot deny that meditation has helped me to focus on a depressing environment.

In short:
Discussions, health, sports, sunlight, sleep, focus, revision at the last moment, 
music before the interview, doc for previous work, make notes and short notes, strategy: two subjects at a time, short timelines,
aptitude and prob stats, Every family has some issues, 

In a Competitive Situation, Game Theory can tell you how to be smart.

If you're a junior, I'd wish you luck for your placements.
Be smart and happy new year :)

## Campus Placement Preparation (Software) (&#x1F4D8;) :

<!-- Competitive Game Theory assumes each candidate as the best candidate -->
No doubt, getting a decent job in the software will ask you for your problem-solving skills and coding skills, but that's not enough. There are some qualities like teamwork, leadership, communication skills, among others, are also crucial. While these are critical skills, I believe there are more skills, and they are very important. Patience and persistence. Students must not get over excited if they perform great in some contests/exams and they should be consistent enough all throughout. Sometimes, the best coders might not make it to them. This could be due to many reasons; maybe they couldn't make it in the aptitude round or lacked soft skills. Aptitude plays a key role in some of the companies. One big challenge students face is that they do not follow a proper structure; rather, they rely on random blogs, videos for their preparation. Even I have faced this issue. To help the next generation, I will try to put down all the useful resources in this repo, which I found useful while preparing for my campus placements.

I hope you find it useful; pls give this repo a star if it deserves :p All the best.
